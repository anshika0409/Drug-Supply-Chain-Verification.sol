# Drug Supply Chain Verification

## Project Description

The Drug Supply Chain Verification project is a blockchain-based solution designed to track pharmaceutical products throughout their entire supply chain journey. This smart contract system provides transparent, immutable, and secure tracking of drug batches from manufacturer to end consumer, helping combat counterfeit medications and ensuring drug authenticity.

The system creates a digital fingerprint for each drug batch and records every transaction and transfer in the supply chain, making it virtually impossible to introduce counterfeit drugs without detection. All stakeholders including manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and hospitals can participate in this transparent ecosystem.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a global, trustless pharmaceutical supply chain where every drug can be verified for authenticity, origin, and handling history. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Counterfeit Drugs**: Provide an unbreakable chain of custody that makes it impossible to introduce fake medications
- **Enhance Patient Safety**: Ensure patients receive genuine, properly handled medications
- **Increase Supply Chain Transparency**: Give all stakeholders real-time visibility into drug movement and status
- **Enable Rapid Response**: Facilitate quick identification and recall of problematic drug batches
- **Build Global Trust**: Create a universal standard for pharmaceutical authenticity verification
